## Overview

Let me introduce you to the Wild SQL Ecommerce project! The freshest Data Analytics project of Summer 2022!

Going straight to the point, here I use MySQL Workbench to answer several real-professional-world questions by querying an Ecommerce database with simple and complex queries, ranging from single step ones to multistep queries, combining temporary tables or subqueries, using aggregate functions to make calculations and much more!

This is an alltime bargain with 100% SQL skills showoff!

## Contents

1. `queries.sql` - Contains all the questions and the queries made to answer such questions, you will find as well some comments along the way, explaining what I'm doing.
2. `ERD.pdf` - Entity Relationship Diagram containing all the tables that confirm this Database, showing as well Primary and Foreign keys, as well as the data type per column.

## Datasets:

- `data/preparing_workbench_vApril2022.sql` - File that sets up the parameters to install the Ecommerce database we are going to use. 
- `data/create_mavenfuzzyfactory_vApril2022.sql` - The Ecommerce database itself.
